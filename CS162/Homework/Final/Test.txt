I started with making the Floor Class.
Had it read in the FloorA.txt file and get it into a 2D array
    I could only make it read one file because it wouldn't like me initialize 
    in an if statement.
    FIXED: Initialize outside if statement, use open inside if statement

Then I made a print function in the floor class to make sure it prints correctly
Note: How I made the array, the coordinates were (y,x) instead of (x.y)
      This threw my off for when I was checking the player's next position.
      e.i. I was running into "invisible" walls, when it was just reading the wrong tile.

Then I made the Character header and Player Class, I was trying to make error checking
for invalid input/walls/etc inside Player class, but found it to be easier in the Game class.
I also copied the print function from Floor into game, it made it so I could print my Player
and Ghosts with the text file.

After I had the move function completed, I made the error checking in Game. Once I could move
around I started making a check function to where I could pick up Cherries, Keys, go through doors,
check if Ghost caught me. Nothing really difficult about it. 

Then I started making my Ghost move function. I was confused on how to get him to move back and forth,
until I thought of using a shift variable that I just add to the Ghost's X position to move,
and have a counter in the ghost class when it equals the max amount of moves, make the shift variable
negative and it started moving the ghost back and forth. Originally, had the Ghost "kill" the player if
it was on the same tile, then I read the Assignment again and made it if it was adjacent to the player.

Once all that was done, my main problem was finding out how to initialize all 3 Floors into the Game class.
First, I tried a vector, then I tried using a dynamic array, but it'll always be 3 Floors, so I made a static
array, but I couldn't set the floor. 
    This was because I tried setting up the floor inside the Floor constructor,
    but I realized I can set up the floor inside the Game constructor.

Finally had my array of floors. When testing the Game play originally, I just had FloorA
and tested going up and down ladders with print functions. After I had my array of floors,
I did a replace all in my Game class where curr(my test Floor class) is replaced by floors[bob].
    bob was the int variable name I had my friends name. After that I could go up/down all of the floors.

Lastly, I changed the for loop I was using to move around and play the game to a while loop
with an end boolean so you play until the end. 

My only big challenges were reading in separate floors with if statement, checking player's position,
and creating my array of Floors.

*****ADDITION FOR TESTING FOR FINAL PROJECT*****

When updating the game, I started with moving the ghost around randomly and
stopping it from moving through walls.

The difficult part was getting it to stop going through walls while chasing
was activated. I fixed it by doing a double check and if they both fail it
just moves randomly.

The last part was getting the "Fog of War" down. At first I used two for
loops, one that increments and another the decrements. This still made a
square and not the diamond shape. I realized the second number needs to be
decreased before initialized in the for loop. Success, but there was
overlapping on the maze.

To fix this I just used if statements to check the boundary of the maze. After
wrestling around with it and using gdb, I finally got it so it doesn't crash. 

I hope you enjoy!!!
