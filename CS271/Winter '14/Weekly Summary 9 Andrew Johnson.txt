Weekly Summary #10
Andrew Johnson

Fisrt we get a glimpse at using external functions in C,
Kinda like how we can use C functions in Assembly. Then we go over a different type of UNIX,
this is called GNU, known as GNU's Not Unix. This writer was the creator of EMACS.
Although, EMACS has been wrtiten to be more efficient. We start to use gcc to compile different types of files.
This is because gcc is more of a technical compiler.

Then it goes over AT&T mnemonics which uses a standard C library.
All register names are lowercase and preceed with%
uses letters to suffix size of opperand(b byte, w word, l long)
The sources of each register is in reverse order.
Immediate opperands are used with a $
Then it goes over some example programming on how AT&T uses there weird porgramming.
