Weekly Summary #8
Andrew Johnson

At the start of the reading it goes over how to stop loops,
other than just using ECX when it's 0. It's example uses printing off the ASCII table.
Then we learn how to do a command line arguement and how it fits in the stack.
ESP is how we build our stack and it will be the top of it.
Then it goes over more about comand line arguements and gives example code
of reading the command line and then printing it.

The last couple pages goes over interupts using your code. It describes the different
uses for INT 80 and the different registers to use with it.
