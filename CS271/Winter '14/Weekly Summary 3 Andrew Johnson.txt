Andrew Johnson Weekly Summary #3

It seems like most of this weeks reading focused around the specifics of registers and flags.
The first couple pages went into depth of how to use the command mov with different kinds of registers.
I noticed that when using mov, you don't have to store all the bytes of the item you are storing. You can
choose which bytes of the item you want if you so desire. Says a lot about the eax register and how there
are 3 different types of data with registers. Immediate data which are the kinds we are using most of the time. 
Register data where you call data inside the CPU. Lastly, Memory data which is data stored in a memory address.

Then it goes to flags and the different uses for each kind of flag. There are many useful applications for all
the flags. There was about 18 flags in a list given, and only 8 of them are actually useful for the programmer.
