Week 5
(I emailed you earlier this week asking if there was a week 5 submission because it didn't pop up for me, so I'm turning it in wiht my week 6. Thank You!)


It goes over how when pushing things on the stack then when the computer calls them it takes it from the bottom to the top.
So when I'm coding I need to keep in mind that whenever I'm pushing things, priority is last.

And when pushing registers you need to pop them instead of adding to ESP register.
When using int 80H it calls the system to terminate the program, keep it in mind.


Complexity kills (in Programming), so keep it simple. 
When designing your program, write out everything that needs to happen with the program.

Gives a lot of info about coding wiht ASCII values. i.e. mov byte [ASCLin+edx+1],bl.

Take note that all charaters above 127 on the ASCII table will appear as .

It goes over length of jumps in a program. First it mentions how local labels start with a . like .label

These can be used over and over in their respected functions. 


Week 6

I couldn't find the reading on the website, so I'm assuming there is none for this week.
Please let me know if there actually is.
Thank You!
