Bug Report 2 :
	I used a unit tester for the "village" function and an error
	came up for the numActions variable. It wasn't matching up 
	when after playing the "village" card. I found that it si actually
	returning one less than what the actual card should. This requires 
	a simple fix.
*****
	Fix :
That statement affecting this is "state->numActions = state->numactions + 1"
when all you need to do is "state->numActions = state->numactions + 2"

I'd give this a low priority since it's only a character change and a medium
severity, since you can still technically play the game and finish with this bug.
