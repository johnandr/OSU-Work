Bug Report 1 :
	I was testing the "smithy" function and ran into the problem that they were drawing too many cards. 
		"for(i=0; i<5; i++)" So they were drawing 2 more cards than they should be.

****	FIX :
	Change the line to "for(i=0; i<3; i++)" and then it should be working great

I'd say the prioity is low since it's just a character change, but the severity is high since drawing extra 
can give a big advantage to a player.
