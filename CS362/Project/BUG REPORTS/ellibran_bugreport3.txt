Bug Report 3 :
	I found a bug when unit testing the "greatHall" function. I found the cards in hand weren't
	the same as they should be. It seems that the discard function wasn't being called. I noticed
	that for some reason it has been taken out.

	Fix :
To fix this, all you need to do is call the discardCard function to take "Great Hall" out of your hand.

Priority of this fix is pretty low because the card still works as it should and wont break the game. 

The severity of this is also low since the player will just have another card in their hand, 
they probably wont try to play it a second time.
