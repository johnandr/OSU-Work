When I first started refactoring the functions our of the switch statement, I was trying to understand the game and the rules.
Since this was my first time being introduced to the game I wanted to learn about the cards. I realized that after refactoring 
and testing my council_room function, I was drawing the wrong amount of cards. I orginally had the function only drawing 3 cards.
The for loop for drawing went from 0 to 2. I originally found this with a unittest checking the variables. I noticed they weren't matching.
I know how to use GDB so I decided to run it and breaking the code right before the call. Then I displayed the handCount and watched 
how many times I drew. Turns out it was only 3 cards I was drawing. So I went in and looked at what it the code looked like. 
This was the easiest way for me to see what was wrong. After changing it to draw one more card I tested it again and it seemed to work fine.

Some of Agan's Principles I was using while doing this is, 
1) Trying to understand the system by reviewing what each card did and how the worked with the game.

3) After using the debugger I just went into the code and saw what it was doing.

9) If you didn't fix it, it aint fixed. By this rule I just made sure it was fixed by testing it again after changing it and making sure it was working properly.
