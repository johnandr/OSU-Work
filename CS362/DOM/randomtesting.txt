ASSIGNMENT 3		ANDREW JOHNSON

	To start all of my randomtests obtained around 80-90% coverage. 
	This is a significant improvement where I had as low as 30% to 60% of coverage with my unittests.
	The two cards I decided to randomtest were smithy and outpost. I made local varibales that are simailar to the
	inputsof the funtcions and then after running through the function I compared the game's  state with how it 
	should've changed with the local variables. Going going through an iteration I reset the game state and picked
	a random play to state the next round. I'm honestly going blinding into these tests. I'm trying to make it so 
	it test every viable part of the card, where I'm using up to max players a large number of times. I'm not sure 
	how well the tests are actually doing, but from the results that are coming out of my executable, there seems 
	to be no ERROR that found in the cards. It took me a long time finding out how to start and build a random test,
	but after I found a basis of of writing it, it seemed pretty straight forward.
